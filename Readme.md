## Data Preparation
This section outlines the process of cleaning and merging datasets, creating necessary columns, and preparing dataframes for analysis. Ensuring data integrity and consistency are paramount to uncovering meaningful insights from any Dataset!!

## Exploratory Data Analysis
This section delves into various visualizations and analyses conducted on the electricity generation dataset. Each analysis serves a specific purpose in understanding the complexities of global energy production and consumption.

### Power Generation Capacity per Country
By visualizing the distribution of power generation capacity across different countries, we aim to identify key players in the global energy landscape and understand disparities in energy infrastructure.

### Power Generation Capacity across Sub-Regions
Analyzing power generation capacity across sub-regions allows for a more granular examination of energy production trends, revealing geographical variations and regional energy demands.

### Cumulative Percentage of Power Generation Capacity
Visualizing the cumulative percentage of power generation capacity across countries offers insights into the concentration of energy production, highlighting countries with significant contributions to the global energy supply.

### Cumulative Percentage of Primary Fuel Usage
Understanding the cumulative percentage of primary fuel usage in electricity generation is crucial for assessing the sustainability and environmental impact of energy production methods, guiding policy decisions towards cleaner and more efficient energy sources.

### World Map Visualization
Plotting the distribution of power plants on a world map provides a visual representation of global energy infrastructure, facilitating the identification of regions with high concentrations of energy production facilities and their proximity to population centers.

### Country-Specific Maps
Focusing on specific countries (China, USA, India) allows for deeper insights into regional energy landscapes, including the distribution of power generation capacity and the dominant fuel sources driving energy production. These insights are invaluable for policymakers and industry stakeholders in shaping energy strategies and investments.

These visualizations and analyses were conducted to gain a comprehensive understanding of global electricity generation trends, informing decision-making processes and promoting sustainable energy practices.
